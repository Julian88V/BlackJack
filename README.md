# BlackJack


### Lay Out the Story
#### The game of Blackjack occurs when at the least one player goes against another player whom is the dealer of this card game. Out of this first sentence I am given two objects *Player *Dealer
#### The dealer at this table provides two cards to the player that are face up.  The dealer deals two cards to him/herself from these two cards the player can see one(This helps the player dictate whether they should take another card or not.)
#### Each card has their set value and you want to either get 21 points or get as close as possible to beat the amount that the dealer will get. If the player ties with the dealer the game ends in what is called a push and the player can leave or stay and play.

#### From evaluating the process of the game I can pick out more of the objects that I will need to possibly make for a better functionality of the game. I can see that when you play the game you set at a table that technically has the rules of the game. *Table *Hand *Deck *Card *Rank *Suits

### Figure Out the Hand
#### In the beginning I was creating too many classes. One hand class for the player and another for the dealer. This is where I noticed that I was having some difficulty with the methods to work. Through some effort I noticed that I could give the dealer and the player the object of a hand with one method.
